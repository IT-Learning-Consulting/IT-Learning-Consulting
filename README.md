# Hi, I’m Danny 👋

**AI learner • Builder of learning tools • Warhammer fan**  
Previously **Cybersecurity Course Manager & Instructor (Masterschool)** — now focused on AI + pedagogy.

- 📍 Sweden (Jämtland)  
- 🗣️ Fluent in **English • Svenska • Español**

---

## What I’m doing now
- 🧠 Learning AI and building **personal RAG systems**:
  - **Foundry VTT helper (personal)** — lore search + prep notes
  - **Warhammer Fantasy “mega-RAG” (personal)** — structured, citeable lore
  - **Pedagogy RAG (internal)** — my course books, papers, and notes
- 🎓 Studying **Pedagogik (Pedagogy)** and turning research into plain-language summaries
- 🧩 Making small tools and **Notion templates** that improve learning and productivity

---

## About me
I care about **learning that sticks**. I design tools and workflows around:
- learning how to learn, **growth mindset**, and **anti-procrastination**
- **computational thinking** for problem solving
- **critical thinking** and **creativity**
- time & task management (focus on simple systems people actually use)

My long-term goal with **IT Learning Consulting** is to **modernize education**—the system is behind the times, and I want to help people upskill for the AI era.
